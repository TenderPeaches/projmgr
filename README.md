# README

A local web-app that lets you conduct basic bookkeeping operations, aimed to facilitate the workload of self-employed folks.  

Currently functional features include:  
* Timekeeping: Register your working hours through shifts, defined through a pair of timestamps to mark the shift's starting and ending times. Categorize shifts according to the category of work performed. Print a shift-by-shift breakdown of your work to attach to invoices.
* Invoicing: Set your working rate and create invoices dynamically according to the shifts you worked.
