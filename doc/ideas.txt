Lil game:

Based off SG categories:
    Infantry/Human
    Mobile/Supplies
    Aviary/Exploration
    Organics/Bionics Science

As a player, your goal is to help your faction by offering them support in one of the four categories

    Each category is its own minigame thing
        => supply/logistics/loadout management

+ final part of the gameplay being warfare/deployment, where the unit designs are put to use
